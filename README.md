# Tic-tac-toe

This is a command line Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++ in which you can play either local 2-player or against the computer.
The computer uses the minimax algorithm to ensure perfect play, hence it's impossible to beat.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. If you have GCC (and are on Unix), you can execute `build.sh`, which will create an executable named `tictactoe`. Otherwise, you can compile the project using a different compiler of your choice.
